    <h1>Alex Shillingford</h1>
    <p>Why am I known as the calm and peaceful one? The guy who can face tight timelines,
       deadlines, frustrated callers and chaos without missing a beat or even break a sweat?
       Because when I'm not working, I'm playing the guitar, writing music and giving music
       lessons to students who are as passionate about music as I am. Or maybe it's because
       I'm left-handed.
    </p>

    <p>With experience in Quality Assurance testing and automation for IOS applications at
      Anonyome Labs, as a Customer Service agent for Clearlink and as a Customer Service Advocate
      for Guitar Center, I've channeled these required skills into over 1,000 hours of study and
      practice into Swift, Objective-C and iOS/mobile development, including:
    </p>

    <h3>Swift:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Core Data</li>
      <li>Core Animation</li>
      <li>Networking Client/JSON</li>
      <li>Xcode Unit/UI Testing</li>
      <li>Cocoa Pods/Carthage/Third Party Library implementation</li>
      <li>UIKit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web Development:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>CSS3</li>
      <li>RESTful APIs</li>
      <li>Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Google Firebase</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All my experiences have required great passion, attention to detail, organizational expertise, excellent
      writing and communication skills and tight time management. I brought good, strong, required skills to each
      new position, and left with even greater adeptness, confidence, and in-demand skills to bring to the next job.
      I love learning and bringing creativity to everything in my work and life, working with product management and
      development team members, and getting nerdy with other developers on different layers.
    </p>

    <p>Musicians work hard and show great patience. Ask any musician.</p>

    <p>If you believe that I can help you with your mobile and web development projects, I'd love to hear from you! </p>
